# FishLens

FishLens is an app created to encourage sustainable fishing. It is aimed to reduce overfishing which is one of the biggest and most overlooked problems for marine life that can endanger species of fish. The app can be used to scan the desired location and analyse and find what species of fish are in the around them and will highlight the places of any endangered species of fish as well.This will help ensure that the fishermen can only catch the species that they need, thereby reducing the percentage of overfishing and will also keep endangered species safe.It enables us to be aware of the vulnerable marine life and protect them.
